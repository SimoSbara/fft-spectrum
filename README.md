# fft-spectrum

## Description
This is a simple learning project inspired from [c64-kitty](https://github.com/antirez/c64-kitty) created by [antirez](https://github.com/antirez), where I took some terminal functionality and kitty communication.
The goal of the project is to get a good visualization of Fast Fourier Transform spectrum from the sound of a microphone using [kitty terminal protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).

## What terminal should I use?
* [ghostty](https://ghostty.org) is an advanced terminal with kitty graphics protocol enabled.
* [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is the original terminal implementation of kitty.

## Build on Linux or MacOS
Just run `make`.
